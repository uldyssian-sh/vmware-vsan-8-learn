- Monitor performance improvements

## Prerequisites
- Completed Lab 2: Storage Policies
- Performance monitoring tools available

## Lab Tasks

### Task 1: Performance Baseline
1. Establish performance baseline
2. Identify performance bottlenecks
3. Document current metrics

### Task 2: Performance Optimization
1. Configure vSAN performance settings
2. Optimize network configuration
3. Tune storage policies

### Task 3: Performance Validation
1. Run performance tests
2. Compare with baseline
3. Document improvements

## Expected Results
- Performance baseline established
- Optimizations implemented
- Performance improvements validated

## Next Steps
