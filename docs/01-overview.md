# VMware vSAN 8 Overview

## What is VMware vSAN?

VMware vSAN (Virtual Storage Area Network) is a software-defined storage solution that is fully integrated with VMware vSphere. It pools together local storage devices across a vSphere cluster to create a single, shared datastore.

## Key Features of vSAN 8

### üöÄ New in vSAN 8
- **vSAN Max**: Enhanced performance and scalability
- **Express Storage Architecture (ESA)**: Next-generation storage architecture
- **Improved Compression and Deduplication**: Better storage efficiency
- **Enhanced File Services**: Native file services integration
- **Cloud Integration**: Seamless hybrid cloud capabilities

### üèóÔ∏è Core Architecture Components

#### Disk Groups
- **Cache Tier**: High-performance SSDs for caching
- **Capacity Tier**: SSDs or HDDs for persistent storage
- **All-Flash Configuration**: Best performance with all SSDs
- **Hybrid Configuration**: Cost-effective with SSD cache + HDD capacity

#### Storage Policies
- **VM Storage Policies (VMSP)**: Define storage requirements
- **Failures to Tolerate (FTT)**: Resilience configuration
- **RAID Configurations**: RAID-1, RAID-5, RAID-6 options
- **Stripe Width**: Performance optimization

### üîß Deployment Models

#### Standard Cluster
- Minimum 3 hosts
- Shared storage across cluster
- Automatic load balancing

#### Stretched Cluster
- Geographic distribution
- Automatic failover
- Witness host for quorum

#### 2-Node Cluster
- Small deployments
- External witness appliance
- Cost-effective solution

## Benefits
